Semantic Interoperability Support System (SISS)


The development and implementation of IoT solutions are driven by the knowledge extracted from large amounts of heterogeneous data, generated by a multitude of sensors and devices deployed in the field. 
The management and processing of raw data allows the extraction of knowledge for the implementation of solutions for decision support, monitoring, task and process automation, and mission management of the vehicles and robots involved. However, different IoT platforms and solutions use native data models, which makes their integration and compatibility with existing solutions in the specific application domain difficult.

Currently, IoT and sensor networks in general are being populated by a multitude of devices and systems that function as "data silos" due to the lack of semantic interoperability.

The Semantic Interoperability Support System (SIS) provides a tool for achieving semantic interoperability through support in generating gateways or translator components between two data models. The target data models for translation must be designed for the same application domain, modeling similar entities or expressing similar information.

SIS establishes the mapping between the properties or semantic content of the "source" and "target" data models through semantic analysis and inference of information extracted from the temporal and spatial dimension of IoT data. The following are the five high-level steps performed by the system to establish the resulting mapping for translation.

 * The first step consists of decomposing the example files provided by the user into <key>:<value> pairs. This process facilitates the subsequent classification and association between the semantic contents (value) and the semantic containers (key) of the input and output models.

 * Second, the pairs are processed to extract the keys whose semantic content specifies the time stamp of the data. For this purpose, a simple search based on regular expressions is used to identify the attributes whose semantic content matches the main standards of time stamp representation. Some of the syntaxes or formats covered by the system are ISO 8601 or Epoch. A converter identifies the correspondence between the timestamps of the input and output models and specifies the type of conversion required for the final mapping.

 * Third, the remaining pairs are processed to identify the geoposition markers. Some of the formats currently considered are latitude and longitude, WKT and geohash. For this, the semantic content of the remaining values is processed after the temporal identification of the data, looking for continuous values in the range of plausible values in the definition of coordinates or character strings for the geohash. Finally, the conversion relationship between the spatial marks of the input and output models is extracted for the final mapping.

 * Once the temporal and spatial tags are identified and excluded, a first semantic comparison is performed in search of identical values or with a high degree of coincidence between the input and output models. The Levensthein distance is used to calculate the degree of coincidence. After this treatment, two files will be generated, one with the direct relations traced between the input and output data, together with the keys and the associated syntax for each model. In addition, a file will be generated with the <key>:<value> pairs whose linkage has not been established at this stage ("differences").

 * In the last step, the mapping of indirect equivalences between the remaining pairs of the previous process is performed. In order to establish their relationships, a set of semantic rules will be used whose objective is the classification of values according to the content and semantic relationships between attributes.

To improve the accessibility to the tool, a Graphical user Interface (GUI) and a WEB service implemented with Swagger have been developed and integrated to document the operations available through the tool's REST API. Figure 1 shows the documentation of the API Rest provided by the component.
